I wrote the code that will parse Ian's text file and output a vector of tuples. The important code
is in the VectorTuple.cpp file, and for testing I created two sample text files which should look
like the real text files we'll be using. There is finally a main file that just calls the getVector
function in VectorTuple.cpp (which in turn calls some helper functions). This main function can be 
edited easily to implement all our codes later.
