Team Contract (amiyak2-ryanbk2-dcondr2-idailis2)

Communication
1. Team Meetings: We will meet every week on Tuesdays at 5:00pm. 
2. Assistance: Text in the group chat. Answer questions if you can, if not say "IDK".
3. Respect: All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred,
it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering
to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.
  
Collaboration
1. Work Distribution: At every meeting, we will delegate equal loads to each team member.
2. Time Commitment The weekly work should be no more than 6 hours. 
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist
with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or
programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked –
politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such
as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team
members.
3. Conflict Resolution All conflicts within the team will be decided by a 3+0 blitz chess game on lichess.org.
The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong (Might makes right).
