Meeting 1: Delegated initial work
* Ian extracts basic blocks and edges into a agreed-upon file format using Python and LLVM
* Amiya makes a C++ parser that takes Ian's output and converts it into a vector of tuples 
* David and Ryan begin work on a graph data structure, using an adjacency list.

Meeting 2: Begin merging our work
* Ian and Amiya work together to integrate their project workflows together 
* The C++ parser now outputs a vector of tuple with indices and weights automatically calculated, making it easer to integrate into the data structure. 
* Research and work into the algorithms begins.

Meeting 3:
* Amiya works on the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
* David worked on adding the edge to an adjacency list by changing the formatting from strings to ints. 
* Ryan worked on making the functions comprehensible by adding comments and descriptions for the main purposes for each file.

Meeting 4:
* Amiya and Ian finished up Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
* Ian worked on Tarjan's strongly connected component algorithm
* David worked on the DFS traversal
* Ryan worked on the results part of the written final report
* Amiya worked on the final presentation slides
